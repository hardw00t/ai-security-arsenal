### Finding Template
```markdown
## [FINDING-001] Sensitive Data in Plaintext SharedPreferences

**Severity**: High
**CVSS**: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
**Location**: /data/data/com.target.app/shared_prefs/auth.xml
**MASTG**: MASTG-TEST-0001
**CWE**: CWE-312 (Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information)

### Description
Authentication tokens are stored in plaintext in SharedPreferences,
allowing any application with root access or backup capability to
extract user credentials.

### Technical Details
The application stores JWT authentication tokens in SharedPreferences
without encryption:
- File: auth_prefs.xml
- Key: auth_token
- Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install application and log in
2. Run: adb shell "su -c 'cat /data/data/com.target.app/shared_prefs/auth.xml'"
3. Observe plaintext token in output

### Evidence
[Screenshot or code snippet]

### Impact
An attacker with device access or backup capability can:
- Extract authentication tokens
- Impersonate users
- Access sensitive account data

### Remediation
1. Use Android Keystore for sensitive data storage
2. Implement EncryptedSharedPreferences
3. Set tokens to expire after reasonable period
```
